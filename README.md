## About MainOS

MainOS (short for **Maingron OS**) is a browser based Operating System, originally trying to look like Windows XP. It started as a fun little project. Nowadays it's more and more taking it's own, serious path.

I started MainOS at work, because my boss told me to learn CSS. Since that day I work on MainOS.

If you want to contribute, that would be nice. It's hard to keep up as a single person.
