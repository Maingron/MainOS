## About MainOS

MainOS is a browser based Windows XP clone thing. It is inspired by Microsofts Windows XP and other Windows versions, though it's more and more taking it's own path.

I started MainOS at work, because my boss told me to learn CSS. Since that day I work on MainOS.

If you want to contribute, that would be nice. It's hard to keep up as a single person.
